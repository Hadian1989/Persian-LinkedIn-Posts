# Persian-LinkedIn-Posts
In this project, I have trained ML classification models for a Persian LinkedIn posts using MATLAB. I have gathered a dataset including 300 data samples, and tested Naive Bayes/SVM/Tree/ etc training models for prediction. because the low number of data samples and 3 class labels, I have achieved the highest accuracy of 60% via bagged trees model with KFold=15.
